# Vue masterclass day 2 - exercise 2

You may not use `window.chat` in `chat-section` and `search-sidebar` anymore. Use props to pass down messages. Also use `$emit` to add a new message in `App`.

1. Make it so that `chat-section` is able to accept `messages` and `user` as props
1. Make it so that `search-sidebar` is able to accept `messages`, `searchText` and `searching`
3. Handle the addition of a new message from the `App.vue` component by emitting it from `chat-section`
